## Space-Invaders

In this project, I build a shooter game using JavaScript's framework [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/), a "fast, free and fun open-source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games".

## About

This project's objective was to build a shooter game similar to [York Computer's](https://learn.yorkcs.com/category/tutorials/gamedev/phaser-3/build-a-space-shooter-with-phaser-3/) tutorial. So I used the main idea but I created my own Space Invader shooter game.

## Game

This is a simple endless runner. Enemies appear at the top of the canvas Some shoot you, some pass straight, some pursue you. You control your ship with keyboard **W,A,S,D** while you shoot with **space**. Just destroy as many enemies as you can before you die.

In the beginning, you can add your name and at the end you can check if your score is in the **Leaders Board** . The **Leaders Board** only show top 5 scores if you beat all scores your score will be on top of the other 4 scores.

## Built with

- JavaScript
- Phaser 3
- Webpack
- Eslint
- Babel
- Jest
- API

## How to play

To control your ship you should use these **W,S,A,D**.These are UPS, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT keyboards. To shoot enemies use **space** .
